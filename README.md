# Logistic Regression Classifier

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Logistic Regression classifier from scratch in Python, applied to the Breast Cancer dataset from `sklearn.datasets`. The classifier is used to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on various input features.

## Project Overview

The Logistic Regression classifier is a fundamental algorithm used for binary classification tasks. It models the probability of a binary outcome using a logistic function. This project implements the algorithm without relying on external machine learning libraries like `scikit-learn`.

### Key Components:

- **Breast Cancer Dataset**: The dataset used for training and testing the model. It is a widely known dataset used to classify tumors as malignant or benign.
- **Logistic Regression**: A custom implementation of the logistic regression algorithm to classify the data points.
- **Accuracy Function**: Computes the accuracy of the model by comparing the predicted and actual labels.

## Model Evaluation

The model's accuracy is evaluated on the test set. In this example, the Logistic Regression classifier achieves a high accuracy score when classifying breast cancer data, indicating its effectiveness for this particular binary classification task.
